# Operating-Platforms

  The Gaming Room is a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently only availible in an Android App. To serve multiple platforms, UI adaptibility is utilized by desigining a responsive user interface that adjusts to different screen sizes and orientations.

  The Software Design document provides a robust list of business and technical requirements and design constraints. There is also a comprehensive Domain model to outline the archticeture of the software, as well as a thorough evaluation of the development requirements for Mac, Linux, Windows, and Mobile Devices, including their characteristics, advantages, and weaknesses for each platform. 

  The UML Diagram was the most helpful in guiding the infrastructure of the code development as it outlined the usage of the Singleton Method class that allows Name and ID inheritance.

  If given the choice to improve or revise a section within the document, I would increase the details given within the evaluation, to thoroughly address the differences between each platform's development requirements, and their strenghts, weaknesses, and advantages.

  To implement the user's needs within the software design, it was crucial to consider scalability, storage, cost effectiveness, and security measures as the cornerstones for a seamless transition between platforms. It is incredibly important to consider the needs of the user when designing to enhance user satisfaction and ensure the success of the software and maintain a substantial product.

  To design the software, it was important to make sure that the Singleton Method in the base class was operating effectiveley, in order to create a domino effect of minimum error within the creation of the inheritant classes. In the future, to analyze and design a similar software application, I will begin with an initial problem that needs to be solved and the goal of the product, and build the archticeture around solving that problem and reaching the end goal. UML Diagrams will be utilized to outline classes and objects, and a software design document will be curated to address the basic needs of the software to run efficiently. I will also consider the usage of the software across multiple platforms to increase useability.
